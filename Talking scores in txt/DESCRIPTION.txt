The other files I have provided you with are the main files, but converted into txt, in an open source project called Talking Scores. It converts .XML files to .HTML files for music accessibility. There are a few features I would like to contribute to it but do not have much experience with python and much less with music21. I need you to help me to become familiar with this code in various ways and to help me to make contributions which will improve the project
