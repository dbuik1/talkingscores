            <h3>Current State</h3>
            <ul class="tsp">
                <li>This project currently may produce an acceptable output for fairly simple scores - potentially with multiple instruments.</li>
                <li>At present - most of the testing is carried out using musicxml files exported from MuseScore.</li>
                <li>If the musicxml file is too large - then processing will time out (after about 5 minutes)...</li>
            </ul>

                    <li>Auto summary works on scores with multiple parts.</li>
                    <li>Auto summary now only mentions repetition if is a significant length instead of listing every time each section is repeated. It does however, now mention the number of unique bars.</li>
                    <li>Repetition is now described within the score. Eg this bar was first used at bar 2 and most recently used at bar 7.</li>
                    <li>Describe beat fractions. Eg beat 1 - dotted crochet. Beat 2.5 - quaver.</li>
                    <li>Significantly increased the speed of producing a talking score - potentially over twice as fast.</li>
                    <li>Improved the document outline (how headings are nested) - for easier screen reader navigation.</li>

                    <li>Each instrument is described separately.</li>
                    <li>If the score has multiple instruments - but you don't select all of them for description - you have the option to listen to All instruments together / All selected instruments together / All unselected instruments together. This should help to demonstrate how particular instruments fit into the rest of the score.</li>
                    <li>While reading the Talking Score - music segments can be played back at 50% / 100% / 150% speed - with or without a click track / metronome. This means 6 midi files are created for each single part instrument in each segment. For a long score with lots of parts - this would take too long and the request would time out... Therefore, midi files are now created on demand - when the first midi file from a particular segment is requested.</li>

                <h3>13th February 2022</h3>
                <p class="tsp">Begun working on scores with multiple parts / instruments. Choices from the Options page for each score are now passed to the score generator - but they are not particularly acted upon yet. Added options to play the Selected Instruments and the Unselected Instruments. If these are selected (and eg if there are any unselected Instruments) then a link is added to the top of outputted score; to play the Selected / Unselected Instruments.</p>
                <p class="tsp">A couple of bug fixes.</p>

            <article class="changelog-entry">
                <h3>27th June 2021</h3>
                <p class="tsp">Initial release of analysing the score to identify bars (or groups of bars) that have the same pitch and rhythm, or just the same rhythm, or just the same intervals - in order to provide output such as 'Bars 1 to 4 are used almost all of the way through'.</p>
                <p class="tsp">Also attempts to provide a summary of what might be noticeable when glancing at the music; and its distribution throughout the score - eg 'lots of chords (some Perfect Fifth, almost all minims, mostly 2 notes)' or 'many accidentals (near the end)'.</p>
                <p class="tsp">The lists of repeating bars / groups are not very easy to read at present (especially as they are shown the Score Options page as opposed to the actual Talking Score output page) - so in a later update, they will probably be moved into the main description as eg 'first used at bar 5; most recently used at bar 9'.</p>
